## Motivation

The existing Slack actions were only displayed at the conclusion of
workflow runs, which results in ambiguous job status for long-running workflows. Additionally, existing actions contained limited information and often prioritized the wrong data elements. This GitHub action attempts to solve those issues.

## Sample Output

### Event: `push`

### Event: `pull_request`

Default output if you've not set any attachment will look like this.

## Features

- Ability to display job step status from beginning of workflow to end
- Single slack message that continuously updates the current job statuses
- Support for **push**, **pull_request** events
- Clean and consistent Slack UI
- Lightweight, minimal dependencies, and pure TypeScript
- Lean AWS cloud footprint that utilizes free tier services and cost-optimized services
- Fully open sourced

## Usage

### Create Slack API Token

### Save API Token in GitHub Secrets

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
   Repository settings button
1. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets**.
1. In the **Name** field, specify: `SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN`
1. In the **Value** field, paste the Slack API Token generated in the previous section.
1. Click **Add secret**.

### Update Workflow Action YAML

Incorporate this action into your workflow by copying and pasting the snippets below into workflow .yml file accordingly.

Currently, this action needs to be injected inbetween every step to achieve the best results.

At the **very first part of your workflow**, add this action. The **first time** the action is run, the **channel** field is required as well as any of the optional [configuration settings](#user-content-configuration-options). Add the following snippet at the very beginning of a single job, or in an initialization job that is a pre-req for a multi-job workflow.

**First Action**

```yaml
- uses: techpivot/streaming-slack-notify@v1
  with:
    slack_access_token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    channel: '#builds'
```

> **Note**: Ensure the `channel` value is enclosed in quotes.

Next, copy the same snippet without any configuration options in between every other step as such:

**Actions In Between Other Steps**

```yaml
- uses: techpivot/streaming-slack-notify@v1
  with:
    slack_access_token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

- run: echo "My custom step 1"

- uses: techpivot/streaming-slack-notify@v1
  with:
    slack_access_token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

- run: echo "My custom step 2"
### ... continued
```

In order to handle failures and properly simulate the conclusion of the workflow _(while running inside the workflow)_, the **final** action needs to include the `if: always()` block and an additional variable: `is_final_step: true`.

**Final Action**

```yaml
- uses: techpivot/streaming-slack-notify@v1
  if: always()
  with:
    slack_access_token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    is_final_step: true
```

## Configuration Options

All configuration options are action inputs and should be used inside the YAML `with:` section as key/value pairs.

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Required |

| `channel`         | Slack Channel, private group, or IM channel to send message to. Can be an encoded ID, or a name. This is required to send the first Slack message. Subsequent github actions calls can omit this value for brevity | **Yes**  |
| `username`        | The slack bot user name                                                                                                                                                                                            | No       |
| `icon_url`        | URL to an image to use as the icon for this message                                                                                                                                                                | No       |
| `icon_emoji`      | Emoji to use as the icon for this message. Overrides `icon_url`                                                                                                                                                    | No       |

## How It Works

## Cost Optimization

The current infrastructure is deployed in a dedicated AWS account tht is actively managed by TechPivot. In order to graciously provide the bandwidth to host this service for the public we optimize various parts of the infrastrucure using the following techniques:

- EC2 Spot Instances - Reducing cost by running on small instances that can be interrupted and easily resumed by other instances from a large pool.
- Minimizing the number of EC2 Metrics - Metrics are free for the first 10 and \$0.30/month thereafter.
- Minimizing EBS volume size - Argueably the larger cost of these tiny instances is actually the size of the EBS volumes.
